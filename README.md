## Signal Hackpack v1 Out of Box Experience

This is the code that is running on the hackpack the very first time you turn it on. Powered by [littleBits](http://littlebits.cc) Arduino and a [NeoPixel 8x8 LED array](http://www.amazon.com/NeoPixel-Rainbow-Matrix-Arduino-Built/dp/B00OM0UTS2), the hackpack is an excellent way to display your creativity to your peers at Signal.

For details on how the hardware and Arduino IDE work, check out Ricky Robinett's [How to Build Your Own Hackpack](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/05/how-to-build-your-own-hackpack.html).

For more details on the code in this repo, read [Light Up Your Hackpack With the Adafruit NeoMatrix Library](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/05/light-up-your-hackpack-with-the-adafruit-neomatrix-library.html). This will give you more information on how the basic building blocks of LED programming work.

We're super excited to see what you build with your hackpack. If you're at Signal, stop by the Hackpack area and say hi to me. Show me what you built and we'll make sure it gets seen by the Twilio community. 

Happy hacking!
